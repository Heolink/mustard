Mustard is an open source marketplace platform, similar to [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/). It is developed and maintained by [Hamjoint CIC](http://www.hamjoint.org/) for [Hamjoint Market](https://www.hamjoint.com/market), a marketplace dedicated to amateur radio and electronics.

Mustard is dependent on several components of the [Laravel framework](http://laravel.com), and supports [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for dependency management. Building a Mustard-based application requires some knowledge of PHP development.
